This directory is a dump of all scripts I wrote and ran during the hackathon. Much of the code is messy and was run interactively via IPython for exploratory analysis, some of it may be out of order.  
Note that in all scripts data is loaded in from the (local to this directory) `data` folder which is not pushed here to avoid redundancy.
